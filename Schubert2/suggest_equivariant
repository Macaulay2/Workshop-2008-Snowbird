Hi,

Here are some ideas/wishes concerning torus-equivariant classes.  The
first is reasonably easy to implement, not sure about no 2 and 3 (who
are quite similar, actually).

1. Equivariant Chern class computations
   ====================================

I suggest expanding Schubert2 to deal with equivariant classes, at
least for torus actions.  Most of the functionality will work with
very small modifications.  

"base" could be given an optional argument for including data for a
torus, like the rank and possibly names for the elements of a basis
for the (additive) group of characters on the torus.  These basis
elements t_i have degree 1 (or possibly a multidegree) and act as 1st
chern class of the corresponding 1-dimensional representations
(=equivariant line bundles on a point).

A vector bundle or sheaf can have equivariant Chern classes, and the
equivariant Chow ring is an algebra over the ring of formal power
series on t_1,...,t_r .  

To construct i.e. a projective 4-space with a torus action with
weights a, b, c, d (linear combinations of the t_i-s), do
something like 

     projectiveBundle( o(a)+o(b)+o(c)+o(d), pt ....)  

where the base pt has the data of the torus as above.  This will
"automatically" give the correct equivariant Chow ring.  

Similarly for Grassmann bundles an so on.


2. Alternative way to compute integrals on varieties with
   a torus action with a finite number of fixpoints
   =====================================================

This is Bott's residue formula.  Data required are the
following:
a) a list of the fix points
b) for each fix point, the set of tangent weights
c) the (equivariant) class to be integrated should also
   be represented via data local to the fixpoints

This is quite different from the "schubert" way of integrating
classes, but it is vastly more efficient in some cases.

(There are variations of this if we relax the condition on
finiteness of the fixpoints.  It can be made to work if we
know the Chow ring of each fixpoint component, together with
the equivariant normal bundle of each such component.)


3. Alternative way to describe the Chow ring for varieties
   with a torus action with a finite number of zero-dimensional
   and one-dimensional orbits.
   ===========================

This is the theorem of Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson.  The equivariant
Chow ring of such an X consists of those sets of classes over the
fixpoints that are compatible along the one-dimensional orbits.  Input
data in this case is the graph of fixponts and one-dimensional orbits
joining them (they are projective lines), and the tangent weights of X
and of the fixed lines at the fixpoints.

To compute in such a ring, classes would be represented by functions
from the fixpoint set to the polynomial (formal power series) ring
which is the eqivariant Chow ring of a point.  Ring operations are
pointwise.  Integral comes from Bott's formula.  

One can also have morphisms of such data structures, together with
pullback and pushforward.  Blowups are easy to define, and so on.  

This approach to intersection rings is particularly useful when
dealing with certain moduli spaces, where a complete description of
the space is unavailable, but the data of the fixpoints are easier to
get at (corresponding to objects fixed by the T-actions).  The
computation of the number of twisted cubic curves on a general quintic
threefold is way faster this way than others.



There might be a way to pass from the G-K-M description of the Chow
ring to describing it in terms of generators and relations; this would
amount to solving a number of equations (congruences actually).  This
is actually an interesting problem, I think.
