-- initial comments: noetherNormalization takes in an ideal I of a
-- ring R over a field k such that the dimension of I in R is d (fix
-- these symbols for all comments) and returns a linear transformation
-- that puts the ideal in Noether position as well as the independent
-- variables of R.

-- comments: The procedure integralSet takes a Groebner basis G (ie. a
-- list of polynomials) and returns the variables that already have an
-- integral relation. It does this by taking the lead monomial of each
-- polynomial and checking whether or not it consists of a power of a
-- single variable. We are assuming that the ring is over a field and
-- thus we don't check the lead coefficient.


integralSet = G -> (
     J := {};
     M := gens G;
     for i from 0 to numgens source M - 1 do ( -- check the gens of G to see if their leadMonomial is in a single variable
           if # support leadMonomial (M)_(0,i) === 1 then J = J | {support leadMonomial (M)_(0,i)} --checks how many vars are in the lead
           );
     J = unique flatten J; --note that according to the algorithm J is a set of integers (in fact indices), we choose to return the variables
     J);

--=========================================
--comments: 

-- varPrep is the initial function we run on the Groebner basis of the
-- inputted ideal I. It returns sets U and V, with U being
-- algebraically independent and V being algebraically dependent. For
-- all prime ideals it returns a maximal algebraically independent set
-- of variables whose cardinality is equal to d.

varPrep = (X,I) -> (
     U := support (independentSets(I,Limit => 1))_0;
     (U,X - set U)
     );

--================================================== 

-- comments: We use lastCheck to check that our final Groebner basis
-- (the gb of the ideal after the change of variables) witnesses the
-- integrality of each variable that should be integral. It first
-- checks that there are no elements of the Groebner basis with support
-- in the independent variables and then that each variable that
-- should be integral after the linear transformation is integral.

lastCheck = (X,G,d) -> (
     M := gens G;
     i := 0;
     while i < numgens source M and not isSubset(support M_(0,i),toList(X_{0..d-1})) do ( 
	  i = i+1;
	  );
     if i != numgens source M then return false
     else(
     	  if X_{d..#X-1} != integralSet(G) then return false
	  );
     true
     );
--==============================================

-- comments: inverseSequence is used to give the inverse of a ring
-- map. A ring map is given by a list explaining where each of the
-- ring's variables should go. If the ring map is just a permutation
-- of the variables then it is obviously an isomorphism and
-- inverseSequence returns the sequence that gives the inverse
-- morphism.

inverseSequence = (U,X) -> (
     N := {};
     for i to #X - 1 do (
	  for j to #U - 1 do (
	       if X_i == U_j then (
		    N = {X_j}|N;
		    break;
		    );
	       );
	  );
     return N;
     );

inversePermutation = f -> (
     N := {};
     X := gens source f;
     U := flatten entries matrix f;
     for i to #X - 1 do (
	  for j to #U - 1 do (
	       if X_i == U_j then (
		    N = N|{X_j};
		    break;
		    );
	       );
	  );
     return map(source f, target f, N);
     );

--========================================================

-- comments: randomSum is used to make the random linear
-- transformations which are candidates for putting I in
-- noetherPosition. It takes in two lists and adds the second to the
-- first with random coefficients.


randomSum = (U,V,k,rr) -> (
     for j to #V - 1 do (
	  if rr == 0 then 
	  U = apply(U, i -> i + random(k)*V_j) else 
	  U = apply(U, i -> i + random(-rr,rr)*V_j);
	  );
     return U;
     );
--========================================================


-- comments: noetherNormalization is the main method. I is passed to
-- it by the user and it's Groebner basis is immediately computed.  It
-- takes the ideal and does a random linear transformation adding to
-- the independent variables the dependent ones that are not initially
-- integral. It then checks that the transformation put the ideal in
-- Noether position. It does this bye partially computing a Groebner
-- basis for the ideal until the partially computed Groebner basis
-- witnesses the integrality of all of the dependent variables. If the
-- entire Groebner basis is computed and the integrality is never
-- witnessed then we apply another random linear transformation and
-- start the process again. While doing all this we keep track of the
-- maps and the inverses of the maps that we use.
