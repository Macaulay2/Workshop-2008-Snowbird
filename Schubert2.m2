    A package for computations in Intersection Theory
  Description
    Text
      The primary purpose of this package is to help compute with intersection theory
      on smooth varieties.  An @TO AbstractVariety@ is not given by equations.
      Instead, one gives its intersection ring (usually mod numerical equivalence),
      its dimension, and the chern class of its tangent bundle.  An @TO
      AbstractSheaf@ is represented by its total chern class (or by its chern
      character).  An @TO AbstractVarietyMap@ is a 'morphism' of abstract
      varieties, and the information encoded is the pull-back to the corresponding intersection rings.
    Text
      This package and its documentation are still rather incomplete, but see the examples
      @TO "Lines on hypersurfaces"@ and @TO "Conics on a quintic threefold"@, which should
      be enough to figure out some of what's possible.

    The Schubert2 data type of an abstract variety
  Description
   Text
     An Abstract Variety in Schubert 2 
     is defined by its dimension and a QQ-algebra, interpreted as the rational Chow ring.
     For example, the following code defines the abstract variety corresponding to P2,
     with its Chow ring A. Once the variety X is created, we can access its structure
     sheaf OO_X, represented by its Chern class

   Example
     A=QQ[t]/ideal(t^3)
     X=abstractVariety(2,A)
     OO_X
     chern OO_X
   Text
     A variable of type AbstractVariety is actually of type MutableHashTable, and can
     contain other information, such as its @TO TangentBundle@. Once this is defined,
     we can compute the Todd class.
   Example
        X.TangentBundle  = abstractSheaf(X,Rank=>2, ChernClass=>(1+t)^3)
        todd X
   Text
     If we want things like the Euler characteristic of a sheaf, we must also
     specify a method to take the @TO integral@ for the Chow ring A; in the case
     where A is Gorenstein, as is the Chow ring of a complete nonsingular variety,
     this is a functional that takes the highest degree component. 
     In the following example, The sheaf OO_X is
     the structure sheaf of X, and OO_X(2t) is the line bundle with first Chern class 2t.
     The computation of the Euler Characteristic is made using the Todd class and the 
     Riemann-Roch formula.
   Example
     integral A := f -> coefficient(t^2,f)    
     chi(OO_X(2*t))
   Text
      There are several other methods for constructing abstract varieties: the following functions
      construct basic useful varieties (often returning the corresponding structure map).
      @TO projectiveSpace@,
      @TO projectiveBundle@,
      @TO flagBundle@,
      @TO base@.

    the class of sheaves given by their Chern classes
  Description
   Text
     This is the class of a sheaf as defined in the package
     @TO Schubert2@.
     An abstract sheaf is really the data of its base variety
     (see @TO AbstractVariety@), @TO Rank@, @TO ChernClass@...
   Text     
     For example, the Horrocks-Mumford bundle on projective 4-space
     can be represented by the following text. We first compute a ``base variety''
     that is a point {\tt pt}, and a variable integer named {\tt n}, in 
     terms of which we can compute the Hilbert polynomial.

   Example
    pt = base(n)
    X = projectiveSpace(4,pt,VariableName => h)
    F = abstractSheaf(X, Rank => 2, ChernClass => 1 + 5*h + 10*h^2)
    chi(F**OO_X(n*h))

   Text
     Here in the description of X the number 4 is the rank of the trivial bundle, pt 
     is the base variety of the projective space (in general, we allow
     projective spaces over an arbitrary base AbstractVariety), and the 
     variable name specifies the variable to use to represent the first
     Chern Class of the tautological quotient line bundle on the projective space.

     Example using Schubert2
  Description
   Text
        There are d+1 conditions for a line to be
        contained in a general hypersurface of degree d in Pn.
        The Grassmannian of lines in Pn has dimension 2(n-1).  Therefore,
        when d+1=2(n-1), we should expect a finite number of lines.
        Here is a way of computing the number using Schubert2.  In the case
        of lines on a quintic hypersurface in P4, this computation was done
        by Hermann Schubert in 1879.
   Text
        We will first illustrate the method by computing the number
        of lines on a cubic surface in P3.
   Text
        We first construct an @TO AbstractVariety@ representing
        the Grassmannian of lines in P3 with its tautological sub-
        and quotient bundles.
   Example
     G = flagBundle({2,2}, VariableNames => {,c})
     (S,Q) = G.Bundles
   Text
        Any cubic surface is given by a cubic form on P3,
        that is, an element of the third symmetric power of the
        space of linear forms, which is the trivial rank 4 bundle
        on P3.  Its image in the third symmetric power
        {\tt symmetricPower(3,Q)}  of the
        quotient bundle {\tt Q} vanishes at those points of the
        Grassmannian that correspond to lines on which the
        cubic form vanishes identically, that is, lines
        contained in the cubic surface.  The class of this
        locus is the top Chern class of this bundle.
   Example
        B = symmetricPower(3,Q)
        c = chern(rank B,B)
        integral c
   Text
        We can do the same thing for any n, (with d=2n-3) as
        follows:
   Example
        f = n->(G = flagBundle({n-1,2}); integral chern(symmetricPower(2*n-3,(G.Bundles)_1)))
        for n from 2 to 8 do print( time f(n))
   Text
        The function {\tt time f 20} takes 16 seconds on a
        64-bit MacBook Pro and produces a number of 53 digits.
   Text
        Note: In characteristic zero, using Bertini's theorem,
        the numbers computed can be proved to be equal
        to the actual numbers of distinct lines 
        for general hypersurfaces.  In P3, every smooth cubic
        surface in characteristic zero have exactly 27 lines.
        In higher dimensions there may be smooth hypersurfaces for which
        the number of lines is different from the "expected" number
        that we have computed above.
        For example, the Fermat quintic threefold has an infite number
        of lines on it.

     "Conics on a quintic threefold"       
  Headline
     Example using Schubert2
  Description
   Text
     The number of conics (=rational curves of degree 2) on a general
     quintic hypersurface in P4 was computed by S. Katz in 1985.  Here
     is how the computation can be made with Schubert2.
   Text
     Any conic in P4 spans a unique plane.  Hence the space of conics in
     P4 is a certain P5-bundle over the Grassmannian {\tt G} of planes in P4.  This
     space is called {\tt X} in the following code:
   Example
     G = flagBundle({2,3})    -- Grassmannian of planes in P4
     (S,Q) = G.Bundles        -- Q = rank 3 tautological quotient bundle
     B = symmetricPower(2,Q)  -- The bundle of quadratic forms on the variable plane
   Text
     As a matter of convention, a projectiveBundle in Schubert2 parametrizes the
     rank 1 quotients.  The P5-bundle of conics is given by sublinebundles of B, so
     we take the dual in the following:
   Example  
     X = projectiveBundle(dual B, VariableNames => {,{z}})
   Text
     The equation of the general quintic is a section of the fifth symmetric
     power of the space of linear forms on P4.  The induced equation on any given
     conic is an element in the corresponding closed fiber of a certain vector
     bundle {\tt A} of rank 11 on the parameter space {\tt X}.  On any given plane P,
     and conic C in P, we get the following exact sequence:
           $$ 0 \to H^0(O_P(3)) \to H^0(O_P(5)) \to H^0(O_C(5)) \to 0$$
     As C varies, these sequences glue to a short exact sequence of bundles on X,
     to give
   Example
     A = symmetricPower_5 Q - symmetricPower_3 Q ** OO(-z)
   Text
     A given conic is contained in the quintic if and only if the equation of the
     quintic vanishes identically on the conic.  Hence the class of the locus of
     conics contained in the quintic is the top Chern class of {\tt A}.  Hence
     their number is the integral of this Chern class:

     integral chern A

     If F is the flag bundle parametrizing subspaces of dimension s and their respective
     quotient spaces of dimension q of an n-dimensional vector space A, such as
   Example
     base(0, Bundle=>(A, 8, a))
     F=flagBundle ({5,3},A)
   Text
     where q = 3 and n = 8, we may think of F as the space of projective (q-1)-planes
     in P^(n-1). Fix a complete flag of projective subspaces A_0..A_{n-1} in A.
     The mechanism {\tt F_(a_1..a_q) }, where 0<= a_1 <= .. a_q <= n-1
     produces the class of the Schubert cycle consisting of those
     (q-1)-planes meeting A_i in dimensions a_1 .. a_q. 
  Caveat
   Code only deals with Grassmannians, not with general flag bundles.
