A list of projects, and people "assigned" to each:

Each of these projects is designed to get us going: they all involve working on
code which already exists.  The idea for many of these projects is to clean up
the documentation, add examples and tests, and make sure the code is
functional.

1. Boij-Soederberg
   Gwyn and Sonja M.

2. "Clean" the primary decomposition code
   Ed and Hiro

3. Groebner walk and/or interfaces to gfan, 4ti2
   Josephine and Andrew

4. Schur functors; plethysm
   Mauricio and Anton

5. Local rings
   Alexandra, Daniel, Tina

6. Rees algebras
   Amelia and David

7. Points (Buchberger-Moeller, and code that David/Sorin have)
   Greg and Stein

8. Brunsification, possibly also "vet" a couple of packages that are
   mostly complete (NoetherNormalization, GenericInitialIdeals, SimplicialComplexes)
   Sonja P.
   Adam

9. (Possibly) interface to Sage
   Bill and Mike
