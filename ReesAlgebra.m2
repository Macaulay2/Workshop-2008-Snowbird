-- Comment : The definition of Rees algebra used in this package is 
-- R(M) = Sym(M)/(intersection over g of L_g) where the intersection 
-- ranges over all maps from M to free R-modules and L_g is the kernel 
-- of Sym(g) (where Sym(g): Sym(M) -> Sym(R)).

-- For computation the key is that R(M) = R(f) where f is any map from 
-- from M to a free module F such that the dual map F^* -> M^* is surjective
-- and R(f) is the image of Sym(f).

 
-- PURPOSE : Compute the rees ring of the image of a 
--           a matrix regarded as over a quotient ring.  
-- INPUT : 'f' a matrix and 'I' and an ideal over a polynomial ring OR 
--         a module over a polynomial or quotient ring. 
-- OUTPUT : an Ideal defining the Rees algebra of the image of f regarded 
--          as a matrix over the ring of I mod I if f is a versal embedding 
--          For the module or if f is not a versal embedding it naively computes 
--          the defining ideal of the Rees algebra and the output may be correct 
--          and it may be nonsense.
-- COMMENT : If I is the zero ideal and f is the generators of an ideal then 
--           the ideal is this is the usual
--           defining ideal of the usual Rees Algebra. Otherwise f 
--           corresponds to the versal embedding as defined in Eisenbud, 
--           Huneke, and Ulrich.  Also the Module version just sets up 
--           the input to use symmetric Kernel on a Module.  See "OUTPUT" 
--           for caution.
