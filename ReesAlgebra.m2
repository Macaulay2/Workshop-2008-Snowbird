-- Comment : The definition of Rees algebra used in this package is 
-- R(M) = Sym(M)/(intersection over g of L_g) where the intersection 
-- ranges over all maps from M to free R-modules and L_g is the kernel 
-- of Sym(g) (where Sym(g): Sym(M) -> Sym(R)).

-- For computation the key is that R(M) = R(f) where f is any map from 
-- from M to a free module F such that the dual map F^* -> M^* is surjective
-- and R(f) is the image of Sym(f).

 
-- PURPOSE : Compute the rees ring of the image of a 
--           a matrix regarded as over a quotient ring.  
-- INPUT : 'f' a matrix and 'I' and an ideal over a polynomial ring OR 
--         a module over a polynomial or quotient ring. 
-- OUTPUT : an Ideal defining the Rees algebra of the image of f regarded 
--          as a matrix over the ring of I mod I if f is a versal embedding 
--          For the module or if f is not a versal embedding it naively computes 
--          the defining ideal of the Rees algebra and the output may be correct 
--          and it may be nonsense.
-- COMMENT : If I is the zero ideal and f is the generators of an ideal then 
--           the ideal is this is the usual
--           defining ideal of the usual Rees Algebra. Otherwise f 
--           corresponds to the versal embedding as defined in Eisenbud, 
--           Huneke, and Ulrich.  Also the Module version just sets up 
--           the input to use symmetric Kernel on a Module.  See "OUTPUT" 
--           for caution.

-- PURPOSE: Computes the universal embedding of the 
--          image of f, or of M or of J over a quotient ring.  
-- INPUT : 'M' a matrix and 'I' an ideal defined over a polynomial ring.
-- OUTPUT : a map that is a versal embedding of the image of M over the 
--          ring of M mod I.  
-- COMMENT : The purpose is to compute a universal embedding to be used in 
--           symmetricKernel in order to compute a Rees Algebra in the most 
--           general case possible at this time as defined in Eisenbud, Huneke 
--           and Ulrich.

universalEmbedding(Module) := Matrix => (M) -> (

-- PURPOSE : Front end for computing the defining ideal of the Rees algebra 
--           of a module, or an ideal defined over a polynomial ring or a 
--           quotient ring.
-- INPUT : 'M' a module OR
--         'J' an ideal 
-- Options : The computation requires additional variables.  The user 
--           can use Variable => to specify the letter used for the 
--           new indexed variable.  The default is the letter w.  The 
--           default algorithm is symmetricKernel, but in the case of 
--           an ideal over a polynomial ring the user might want to use 
--           the algorithm in reesSaturate specified by Strategy => Saturate.
-- OUTPUT : an Ideal defining the Rees algebra of the module M or of the ideal J.
-- COMMENT : Uses proposition 1.3 in Eisenbud, Huneke, Ulrich and computes 
--           the rees algebra of a versal embedding of the 
--           Module regardless of the ring and for an ideal over a quotient ring. 
--           In the case of an ideal over a polynomial ring the process is slightly 
--           streamlined, skipping the unneccessary versal computation as in that 
--           case the inclusion map is a versal map.

-- COMMENT : I have a note stating that "right now" this computation 
--           requires a polynomial ring over a finite field - written 
--           in 2000/2001.  I have no idea why.  I suspect that at the

T. Roemer,  "Homological Properties of Bigraded Modules"
Römer, Tim(D-ESSN)
Homological properties of bigraded algebras. (English summary) 
Illinois J. Math. 45 (2001), no. 4, 1361--1376. 
 Thm 5.3
shows that if i is and ideal in the polynomial ring,
generated in degree d (and maybe i is 
primary to the maximal ideal) then
  reg(I^j) = jd + b for m>-=j0
where j0 is the max degree in the "new variables" of
a bigeneric initial ideal of reesIdeal(i)
(bigeneric means we allow general changes of coords in
the new vars alone and in the old vars alone.)

Eisenbud and Ulrich have shown that there is a similar bound
in terms of the regularity with respect to the variables y
(graded with the degrees of the generators of i). This is proven
only in the case of ideals generated in a single degree and
primary to the maximal ideal. 

Research Problem: what's the situation in general?
