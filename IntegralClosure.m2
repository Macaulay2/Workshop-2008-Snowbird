-- PURPOSE : Front end for the integralClosure function.  It governs
--           the iterative process using the helper function
--           integralClosureHelper. Generally implements DeJong's
--           algorthim to compute the integral closure using the
--           non-normal locus.
-- INPUT : any Ring that is a polynomial ring or a quotient of a
--         polynomial ring that is reduced. 
-- OUTPUT : a sequence of quotient rings R_1/I_1,..., R_n/I_n such
--          that the integral closure of R/I is the direct sum of
--          those rings 
-- HELPER FUNCTIONS: integralClosureHelper      
--                   nonNormalLocus  - computes the non-normal locus
--                   idealizer - a sequence consisting of a ring map
--                   from the ring of J to B/I, where B/I is
--                   isomorphic to Hom(J,J) = 1/f(f*J:J), and list of
--                   the fractions that are added to the ring of J to
--                   form B/I  .
-- COMMENTS: 
-- (1) The quotient rings are not necessarily domains.  The
-- algorithm can correctly proceed without decomposing a reduced ring
-- if it finds a non-zero divisor with which to compute 1/f(fJ:J). 
--
-- (2) The functional design is to allow a user to do individual steps
-- in DeJong's algorithm easily.  In particular, nonNormalLocus and
-- idealizer are now stand alone functions.  This could alow study of
-- the role of different choices of the non-zero element f in
-- idealizer, or of different possibly choices that "work" for the
-- nonNormalLocus. 

--- Should Singh/Swanson be an option to integralClosure or its own
--- program.  Right now it is well documented on its own.  I'm not
--- sure what is best long term.
